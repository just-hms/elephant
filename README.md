# Elephant

> A small program with a log memory

- run `el` to show you the list of command launched in the current dir.
- used `shift` + `Tab` to show you suggestions based on them (requires  `fzf`)


## todo

- [x] `install.sh` make it installable with a single command
- [x] add something similar to ctrl+R in bash (even if it is not a shortcut, find a way to write in the curren command)
- [ ] `--purge` removes history of folder which don't exist anymore
